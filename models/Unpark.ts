/**
 * FreeClimb API
 * FreeClimb is a cloud-based application programming interface (API) that puts the power of the Vail platform in your hands. FreeClimb simplifies the process of creating applications that can use a full range of telephony features without requiring specialized or on-site telephony equipment. Using the FreeClimb REST API to write applications is easy! You have the option to use the language of your choice or hit the API directly. Your application can execute a command by issuing a RESTful request to the FreeClimb API. The base URL to send HTTP requests to the FreeClimb REST API is: /apiserver. FreeClimb authenticates and processes your request.

 * The `Unpark` command resumes a parked call.  Execution continues with the first command in the PerCL scripted returned by the actionUrl specified in the Park command as long as the call is still in progress.  If the call is no longer in progress, any returned PerCL will not be executed. Unpark is a terminal command -- any commands following it in the same script are not executed.
